The abstract page is optional for projects but it is required for thesis. Your Abstract must be a “complete snapshot” of your manuscript and be a stand-alone piece. Since the text of the Abstract may be distributed widely through a variety of databases, formal citations, images, and complex equations should not be included. Paragraph one introduces your specific problem and the methods used. The remaining paragraphs present the research and results in details.
